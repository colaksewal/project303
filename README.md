# Project303 - Exam Scheduling

## Overview
Project303 is a scheduling tool comprising four classes: `Classroom`, `Course`, `ExamScheduler`, and `Main`. The `Classroom` and `Course` classes define the properties for rooms and courses, forming the main structure of the schedule. The `ExamScheduler` class includes an algorithm to create schedules, ensuring a proper arrangement. The `Main` class retrieves data from CSV files and utilizes this data by calling related functions.
